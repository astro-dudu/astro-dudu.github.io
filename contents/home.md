I born on the surface of the Earth in 2005 (Shantou, Guangdong Province, China). I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in physic, at Institute for Advanced Study, Shenzhen University, China. I primarily engaged in research on the interpretation of Chang'e-5/6 lunar radar (Lunar Regolith Penetrating Radar, LRPR) data and the inversion of lunar surface geological process (under the supervision of Researcher Ding Chunyu).
