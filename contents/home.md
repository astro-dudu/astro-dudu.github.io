I born on the surface of the Earth in 2005 (Shantou, Guangdong Province, China).I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Physic, at Institute for Advanced Study, Shenzhen University, China. I am currently under the supervision of Researcher Ding Chunyu, primarily engaged in research on the interpretation of Chang'e-5/6 lunar radar (Lunar Regolith Penetrating Radar, LRPR) data and the inversion of lunar surface geological process. I have published a paper as the first author in the journal Earth and Planetary Physics (Q2), titled 'Research Progress on Internal Characteristics of Asteroids and Comets: Implications of Tianwen-2 Radar Observations.'
